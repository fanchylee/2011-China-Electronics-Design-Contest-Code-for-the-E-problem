@W: FX474 |User specified initial value found in some of the sequential elements in the design. Applying an initial value to a register may not deliver the best synthesis results. For example, registers with initial values may be preserved and retiming/pipelining may not be performed. To improve synthesis results you may want to remove the register initialization from the RTL code
